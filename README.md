# Variables-and-Control-Structures

* Create a new Python file in this folder called **InvestmentCalculator.py**

* At the top of the file include the line:
  * import math

* Ask the user to input:
  * The amount that they are depositing, stored as ‘P’
  * The interest rate (as a percentage), stored as ‘i’
  * The number of years of the investment. stored as ‘t’
  * Then ask the user to input whether they want “simple” or “compound” interest, and store this in a variable called ‘interest’

* Only the number of the interest rate should be entered - don’t worry about having to deal with the added ‘%’, e.g. The user should enter 8 and not 8%

* Depending on whether they typed “simple” or “compound”, output the appropriate amount that they will get after the given period at the interest rate

* Print out the answer
